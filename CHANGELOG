4.82.0 (2024-06-09)

- Welcome to High Isle! Most of the new items are accounted for, and I'll fill in the blanks when I can!
- Added drop down filter for writ voucher items - currently only shows crafting stations, but working on getting all writ voucher craftables under that filter as well. Plus some tweaks to the search feature that will hopefully make it easier to use.

4.321

- Added a bunch of crown furnishing packs and adjusted the sourcing on a few items.
- Thanks to everyone who has sent me item info! It's incredibly helpful, and I am slowly working through it all!

4.2

4.0
- No exciting new changes, but the Greymoor recipes will finally work now! \o/ Also, a little restructuring under the hood.

3.9
- Added filter for jewellery crafting type. If your GUI is broken now, please let me know.

3.8
- There's now a "toggle recipe"-button in the settings that you can bind, thanks to remosito. If you bind that, and there's a recipe in the data, both line and tooltip will display the recipe instead of the item.

3.51, 3.52
- Fixed something about rumour items being processed. Still trying to get rid of duplicates / incorrect displays...

3.5
- Took the time to patch up some item sources (crown store / furniture packs / justice). You can help me with this!
- Hopefully got rid of the issue that item sources would show as "rumour" although they weren't. (I lowered the index of the "rumour" key in the data - rumour items should get processed first now, then overwritten with other origins)

3.4
- Added another button to the search box: You can now toggle crown store and rumour items from there. If you do not like the buttons: No problem! You can hide them from the settings.
- Moved a stealable Khajiit pillow from crown store data. You might want to check if the setting for "filter all on text" is active in case you want to display those when using text search.

3.33
- Removed some debug output. Did you know? With LibDebugLogger, you can be rid of those entirely!
- Datamined some on live. Stuffed everything into Crown Store for now.
- Fixed the rumour filtering (at least it works on my machine, hehe)

3.2
- AssemblerManiac was so good to change the way the right click menu worked from overwriting the original handler to the proper callback, which is the way it's supposed to work. If this causes trouble with any other AddOns, it's their fault. :P
- Luxury Furnisher!

3.1
- UI now has a button that lets you toggle display of rumour recipes on the fly.

2.81, 2.82

2.65
- Luxury Furnisher!

2.5.3
- Luxury Furnisher!
- AssemblerManiac was so kind to fix the known/unknown items - they no longer get unloaded if ResearchAssistant is active. (I have no idea why that was in the code, but since it was in the initial commit, I must've thought something about it)

2.0.15

2.0.14

1.91

- Added a new filtering option for "other", which includes items that can be acquired by (you might have guessed) other means than crafting and buying. THESE ITEMS HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED BY HAND, so feel free to send me item links and tell me where you got the stuff!

1.3b
- Fixed an exception caused by the exception fixing

1.3a
- Fixed an exception when opening the buyback menu

- Started to add items to data/MiscItemSources.lua - to be more precise, drops from stealing, fishing, Dwemer constructs, urns and Forgotten Wastes. If you have any additional items that need to go in there, please leave a comment, drop me a PM, or send a mail with the item attached to @manavortex on EU (Yes, this is me fishing for donations!)

1.0
- Morrowind!!!

0.982
- fixed the dropdowns again!

0.981
- verified that all three dropdowns work (they do! Turn on debug output if you need to be reassured. :)) Applied some cable binders to the back-end.

0.98
- The GUI now has dropdowns instead of buttons, and the dropdowns work together. Yay!
- The total number of recipes is now shown in the header
- I have verified that learning a new recipe will cause the database to upgrade. Donations to @manavortex are welcome for that reason because I'm broke and recipes are expensive. :P

0.973
- Hopefully fixed the cursor bug

0.972
- Fixed an error upon learning a new recipe where the AddOn tried to access a boolean

0.971
- I had broken the Furniture Shopping List integration! Fixed Furniture Shopping List integration.

0.97
- your characters will not only be scanned, the scanned data will even be remembered! Yay!
- Characters without furnishing blueprints will not show up in the GUI dropdown
- Deleting characters from the database now works - they will be gone from the dropdown in the menu when you reload UI the next time
- Adjusted the dropdown knowledge: Known and unknown are now buttons on the interface, the dropdown instead filters "All", "Homestead" and "Morrowind". The Morrowind filter doesn't do anything yet, but will probably become crucial in about five weeks.
- Not entirely sure if I have broken the Furniture Shopping List integration? I think I have. Will investigate later.

0.96
- Your characters will now be scanned upon initialisation
- The furniture catalogue UI will now trigger the cursor mode when being opened and remove it when being closed in hudui mode.
- The delay upon switching the filters is now slightly less annoying

0.95
- more help from votan and AssemblerManiac, who are awesome - tooltips look good for me now. Please tell me if you still have problems. You can help me by providing the following information:
-- Where did the problem occur? FurC-Interface, inventory, bank, auction house...
-- What did you do when you noticed it, how can I reproduce it?
-- What is the problem exactly? :D
- Added an option to the menu to hide Mages' guild books from the overview
- You can now re-scan or wipe the database from the GUI. If you're going to wipe, there's even a nifty popup asking you, courtesy by sirinsidiator, who is awesome. All my fellow devs are awesome.

0.94
- Fixed a null pointer exception when hovering over Rollis's item list

0.93
- Added a lot of books to the database
- Added Jesters Festival items to the database
- Added "seen in guild store" as source to items that you... you can probably figure.
- votan gave me a hand fixing the tooltips. I think they might even be fixed now!
- Made sure that the furniture part of the menu shows up at the end of it because of CDO
- Clarified the messages you see in chat when the database is updated
- Added an option in the menu to disable FurnitureShoppingList support. Will obviously only affect the FurnitureCatalogue control (and InventoryInsight!)
- AddOn authors: I added a global function AddFurnitureShoppingListMenuEntry(itemLink, calledFromFurC) for you - just add an item link to add another "Add to shopping list"-entry to your control's right click menu. Does not contain any checks, so use at own risk.

0.92
- Fixed the tooltips. You sick of it yet?

0.91
- Fixed the error when right-clicking something that wouldn't have any entry

0.9
- Fixed the double tooltip issue. Again.
- Items without a recipe will now have "print item source"
